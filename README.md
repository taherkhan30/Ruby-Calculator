# Sparta-Ruby-Calculator


A simple calculator built with Ruby. The calculator does the four basic operations, finds exponents of numbers and can find the square root of a number. The calculater can also find your Body Mass Index and tell you your BMI condition.

I would like to make my code more DRY and include the use of functions
i have added a while loop
currently my code is mostly made of conditional statements
